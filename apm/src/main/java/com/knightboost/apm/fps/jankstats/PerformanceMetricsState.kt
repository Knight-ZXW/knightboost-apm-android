 * to report per-frame performance characteristics along with the application state that was
 * present at the time that the frame data was logged.
 *
 * There is only one PerformanceMetricsState available per view hierarchy. That instance can be
 * retrieved from the holder returned by [PerformanceMetricsState.getForHierarchy]. Limiting
 * PerformanceMetricsState to a single object per hierarchy makes it
 * possible for code outside the core application logic, such as in a library, to store
 * application state that can be useful for the application to know about.
